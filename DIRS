Directory Structure

Each directory with a notable subdirectory structure will contain a DIRS file.

arch: architecture-specific kernel code
code: architecture-indendent kernel code
doc: documentation
include: headers for kernel
lib: library code for kernel
machine: machine-dependent kernel code
projects: build configuration management
third-party: third-party libraries for the kernel (libtommath, etc)
tools: toolchain build system
us: Twizzler userspace code
utils: utilities for building and boostrapping

Note that for architecture and machine dependent code directories, under these there are a set of
directories, one per supported arch/machine.
