Major Breaking Changes
----------------------
 * Update interfaces:
   - ocreate: should take a list of copy ranges for copy-from multiple
   - ocopy: ^
   - ocreate: let users specify memory type and persistence behavior in smarter ways than "yes/no"
   - opin: should take a list of ranges for pinning regions of objects
   - octl: should take a list of ranges to operate on.
   - octl: should take a list of ranges to expose to devices (or just expose the whole object)
 * object_copy should allow src == NULL to mean "zero this range of an object"

High Priority
-------------
 * Recent work on updating object page management and memory management has broken the security
   subsystem. We need to hook this back up. This is largely regarding how the kernel reads data from
   objects (used to be a pointer that you could just access data through, now it's actual read/write
   function that lock pages during access).
 * Similar, for the pager subsystem. This will need a changed manner of accessing queue object data
   from the kernel.
 * Similar, for in-kernel device drivers and device creation (eg the pcie and iommu code).
 * opin and octl syscalls lost functionality in this recent refactoring. This functionality is
   needed for device drivers.
 * Paired with above, the device management system is rather simplistic and hacky. We should
   implement something better.
 * Part of the refactoring lost the functionality of actually using nvdimms. This is a major thing
   we need to get back, obviously, but while we're at it, we should design a better "filesystem" for
   storing object data on nvdimms.
 * Make sure tables (in the x86 subsystem) are managed properly, count-wise.
   - We could also lift this out of arch-specific code, as page-tables are very common (but this is
	 low priority)
 * The refactoring was designed to have objects have a "range tree" that refers to ranges of pages
   in objects, where each range refers to a (possibly shared with another object) pagevec, that
   contains a contiguous range of pages. The idea is that these data structures can by dynamically
   compacted (or appended to). Right now, though, we often create new ranges and pagevecs even if we
   could extend an existing one. A major optimization is to try to use existing ones and extending
   them. This should speed things up a lot as well as save memory.

Medium Priority
---------------
 * The printk system is overly simple. It should write into per-cpu buffers and read by a userspace
   logger (and/or echo'd to consoles like the serial port).
 * Scheduling needs an overhaul -- right now, the scheduler is _too_ simple to work well, and it
   can't move threads between cores. We can probably implement something like the freebsd scheduler
   and core migration and be fine for a while.
 * Scheduling only handles scheduling user threads, and sort-of "manually" runs certain system
   operations here and there. We should assign these tasks (like getting completions from the pager,
   zero-ing pages in the background, etc) as schedulable entities.
 * Time management -- timers and checking timers is probably too expensive. We could make this much
   cheaper.
 * Move to new red-black tree implementation from Miles
 * Handle out-of-resources situations:
   - out of objspace regions / space (requires reclaiming these from objects)
   - out of memory (requires reclaiming pages from objects, or from kernel cached allocations in
	 slabs, or from kheap runs(?))
 * Implement kernel debugging. Currently there is some very basic support for getting symbol
   addresses out of the loaded kernel ELF file, but we could do a lot better.
 * Implement support for userspace debuggers.

Optimizations
-------------
 * Before we do much optimization, we should implement an instrumentation mechanism that will let us
   dynamically time functions in the kernel.
 * The rwlock code is not particularly good -- it's unfair, it's not queued, etc. It could be
   dramatically improved.
 * Memory allocation could be done per-cpu to avoid conflicts. Currently, it's pretty lock-y.

Cleanup
-------
 * x86 subsystem code could use reorganization, especially init.c
