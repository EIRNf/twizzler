BUILDING
========
The build system is make-based, and is relatively straight-forward. You must have a copy of
the appropriate toolchain for the target system (such as x86_64-pc-elf-, or riscv-unknown-elf-,
etc). Acquiring the toolchain for your target is outside of the scope of this repo, see
twizzler-main for information on how to acquire this. The toolchain must be in your PATH.

Building is based around projects. These are self-contained configurations and builds that the
build system uses to make decisions. Existing projects are in projects/, and there are several
pre-configured ones. If you wish, you may add your own. Each project contains, when clean, just
a config.mk file specifying all of the configuration for that project.

When you execute make to build the kernel, you must specify a project to use in the PROJECT
variable, like so: `make PROJECT=riscv`. A project can be tested via the 'test' target like so:
`make PROJECT=riscv test`.
