BUILDING
========
The build system is make-based, and is relatively straight-forward. You must have a copy of
the appropriate toolchain for the target system (such as x86_64-pc-elf-, or riscv-unknown-elf-,
etc). See below.

Building is based around projects. These are self-contained configurations and builds that the
build system uses to make decisions. Existing projects are in projects/, and there are several
pre-configured ones. If you wish, you may add your own. Each project contains, when clean, just
a config.mk file specifying all of the configuration for that project.

When you execute make to build the kernel, you must specify a project to use in the PROJECT
variable, like so: `make PROJECT=riscv`. A project can be tested via the 'test' target like so:
`make PROJECT=riscv test`.

Toolchains
----------
Pre-built toolchains are available from http://googoo-16.ssrc.ucsc.edu/dbittman/twizzler/toolchains.
They're password protected (username 'ssrc', password 'nvram'). Once downloaded, they can be
decompressed and unpacked. They contain compiled versions of gcc and binutils for a particular target.
For example, the twizzler-toolchain-riscv64-1.tar.xz file provides the toolchain for riscv64,
and is version 1. Toolchains will get updated over time, so try to stay current.
