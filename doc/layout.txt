Directory Structure
===================

arch     - Architecture dependent code
           +- <arch>: Each supported processor has a directory here.
core     - Core kernel code (mutexes, threading, allocators, etc), architecture independent
doc      - Documentation
include  - include files (may reference other include files in arch or machine)
lib      - Kernel library (data structures, minimal CRT)
machine  - Machine dependent code
           +- <mach>: Each machine has a directory here.
projects - All build configurations and outputs here.
           +- <name>: Each project has a directory here.
              +- build: Built files for the kernel.

There is a separation between machine and architecture because it is possible for
a single architecture to be present on multiple machines, and vice versa.
