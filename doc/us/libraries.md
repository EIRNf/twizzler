Core Libraries
==============

Twizzler provides three core libraries for programs. They are:
  * libtwz, the core Twizzler library that provides most functionality for Twizzler interfaces.
  * libtwix, a Unix compatibility layer that works by emulating the Linux system call interface.
  * musl, a standard C library, modified slightly to call into libtwix instead of making system
	calls directly.
